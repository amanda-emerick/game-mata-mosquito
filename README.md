## :warning: About the project
This project is part of the Udemy Web Development course, taught by Professor Jorge Sant Anna. It's the final project of Javascript module. The project's main objective was to apply the knowledge acquired in the course up to that moment.

<a id="objective"></a>
## :goal_net: Game Goal
Eliminate all mosquitoes that appear on the screen, surviving until the end of the game. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, difficult and Chuck Norris. Depending on the chosen level, the time that mosquitoes remain on the screen is shorter, increasing the difficulty degree.

## :rocket: New Features
Based on the initial project proposed in the course, I made some improvements in order to give a greater dynamic to the game and also improved the layout. Below are some examples:
- Added animations on the game's home screen and on the winner/game over screens;
- Added sound effects when the player wins or loses;
- Reduction to just two HTML pages: the game page is the same page that shows when the player wins / loses;
- Added a counter for dead and alive mosquitoes, showing these values both on the side panel during the game, and at the end when the player wins or loses, so that he knows how many mosquitoes were killed and how many he let scape;
- At the end of the game, the player can choose to play that same level again, without always having to be redirected to the home page;
- Improved responsiveness to the game, also adapting to mobile.
